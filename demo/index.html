        <p>UpAndAway is a small js script that reveals the top menu (or anything for that matter) when a user scrolls upwards.</p>

        <p>It works similar to the menu on <a href="https://medium.com">medium.com</a></p>

        <p>At its core the script performs two basic functions: It adds a class to a specified element when a user scrolls upwards and switches this class to another one when a user scrolls down.</p>

        <p>It currently supports mouse input, trackpads (even Apples inverted scrolling) and keyboard input.</p>

        <p>I've opened a door here that I regret. I'm afraid I just blue myself. As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. Whoa, this guy's straight? I hear the jury's still out on science.</p>
        
        <h2>Let 'Em Eat Cake</h2>
        
        <p>I'm a monster. I care deeply for nature. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.</li>
            <li>It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life.</li>
            <li>Marry me.</li>

        <h3>Meat the Veals</h3>
        
        <p>I'm afraid I just blue myself. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. I'm afraid I just blue myself.</p>
        
        <p>Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. We just call it a sausage. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.</p>

        <p>That's why you always leave a note! There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! Across from where? We just call it a sausage.</p>
        
        <p>There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. I'm half machine. I'm a monster. Guy's a pro.
